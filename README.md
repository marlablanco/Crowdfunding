# Crowdfunding

Organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to uncover trends and insights. It required utilizing Excel to perform various tasks such as conditional formatting, creating columns for specific calculations (e.g., Percent Funded, Average Donation), and generating pivot tables and charts to analyze project outcomes by category and sub-category, as well as based on launch dates.

## Conclusions:
Trends in Crowdfunding Campaigns: The analysis helps uncover patterns related to project outcomes, category/sub-category performance, and crowdfunding goals, aiding in understanding success factors.

Dataset Limitations: Limitations may include missing data, potential biases, or inadequate representation, impacting the depth of insights drawn.

Additional Insights: Creating tables/graphs analyzing backers' demographics or geographical trends could provide further valuable insights into campaign success.

This assignment aims to develop proficiency in Excel for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, offering valuable insights into crowdfunding project dynamics and success factors.
